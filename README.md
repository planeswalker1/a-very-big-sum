## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about arrays completed in JavaScript._

## challenge

Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those numbers may be quite large.

**Function Description**

Create a function that returns the sum of all array elements.

This function has the following parameter(s):

* ar: an array of numbers.

**Input Format**

The first line of the input consists of an number _n_.
The next line contains _n_ space-separated numbers contained in the array.

**Output Format**

Print the number sum of the elements in the array.

**Constraints**

* 1 <= _n_ <= 10
* 0 <= _ar_[_i_] <= 10<sup>10</sup>


**Sample Input**

```
5
1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005
```

**Output**

```
5000000015
```

**Note:**

The range of the 32-bit number is (-2<sup>31</sup>) _to_ (2<sup>31</sup> _or_ [-2147483648, 2147483648]).
When we add several number values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.
